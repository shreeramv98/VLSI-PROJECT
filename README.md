# VLSI-PROJECT

ABSTRACT-

In the field of Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI), multiplication is an important and computationally intensive operation. The efficiency of the multiplier has always been a critical issue and, therefore, the subject of many research projects and papers. Booth algorithm is a crucial improvement in the design of signed binary multiplication and unsigned binary multiplication. There has been progress in partial products reductions, adder structures and complementation methods but still there is scope in modifying the booth algorithm so as to further optimize. The proposed work aims at this. The modified booth multiplier is synthesized and implemented on XILINX software. In this paper, we have implemented a multiplication of higher bits such as 16-bit multiplier and 16-bit multiplicand to produce a 32-bit multiplied output/number.

OBJECTIVE- To perform 16 bit multiplication of two sixteen bit numbers using booth algorithm in the Xilinx software and to obtain the simulated output (32 bit result) in ModelSim.
